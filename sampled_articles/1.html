<p><span>Birds&#39; eggs and sea shells, beetles and coins, moths and minerals&mdash;as a child, Charles Darwin collected all of these and more. Born in 1809 to a wealthy family in rural England, he spent hours watching birds and lying under the dining-room table, reading. He was an indifferent student, though, and school bored him. He despaired of learning Latin and memorizing verse, &quot;for every verse was forgotten in 48 hours.&quot; But he never tired of studying the details of the natural world.</span></p>

<p>As a teenager, Darwin was thrilled by chemistry, biology, botany and geology. Yet all the while he dutifully pursued the careers his father had selected for him: doctor and then clergyman. As he studied at the University of Cambridge, though, Darwin was singled out by an elite circle of academics who recognized his potential. Finally, his true talent for natural history blossomed.</p>

<h3>A Lifelong Passion</h3>

<p>Although bored at times by formal schooling, the young Charles Darwin poured enormous energy into his fascination with the natural world. As a boy, tired of Greek and Latin, he did chemistry experiments in a homemade lab with his brother Erasmus. At Edinburgh University, instead of studying medicine, he wrote his first scientific papers. And at Cambridge University, where he was sent to become a clergyman, he became so devoted to botany that he took the sole botany course three times.</p>

<p>One scientific hobby, however, stood out above all: collecting beetles. Darwin got into a heated rivalry with another Cambridge student, Charles &quot;Beetles&quot; Babington, over who would acquire a new species first. And when he wasn&#39;t collecting beetles, he was writing excited letters to his cousin William Darwin Fox, confessing, &quot;It is quite absurd how interested I am getting about the science.&quot;</p>

<h3>First Scientific Paper</h3>

<p>Grant was especially interested in primitive sea life like sponges and bryozoans--literally, &quot;moss animals&quot;--because he believed all plants and animals shared a simple marine ancestor. Darwin, too, became interested in this idea and in 1827 presented a paper to a student group on a bryozoan called Flustra.</p>

<h3>Revenge of the beetles</h3>

Many beetles, including the Brachinus crepitans and the Stenaptinus insignis, release irritating chemicals as a defense. Darwin experienced one such defense first-hand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One day, on tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>A World of Change</h3>

<p>When Charles Darwin was a student in the 1820s, no science exerted a stronger hold on the popular imagination than geology. The public followed the latest theories and discoveries in amazement. Thousands bought books on the subject, and debates on the history of the Earth and its formation raged among scientists.</p>

<p>By this time, geologists had shown that Earth was not static or fixed&mdash;clearly it had undergone sweeping changes over time and was, in fact, still changing. This idea had a huge influence on Darwin&#39;s thought. Pondering the long, slow changes in Earth&#39;s history would later help shape Darwin&#39;s ideas about how plant and animal species, too, had changed over millions of years.</p>

<h3>Shifting Layers of Rock</h3>

Photo: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Siccar_Point_red_capstone_closeup.jpg">Dave Souza</a> (CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span>The exposed layers of rock at Siccar Point, Scotland, tell a dramatic story of the ever-shifting movement within the Earth. Beneath the nearly horizontal layers of red sandstone, one can see vertical layers of gray slate. In the late 1700s, Scottish geologist James Hutton realized that these cliffs revealed a long, slow process. The vertical layers were originally laid down horizontally, then lifted and tilted by forces within the Earth. After being worn down by erosion, they sank underwater and were covered by sediment. This sediment also became rock, forming the red upper layers. Later the whole structure emerged above the water.</p>

<p>Such insights changed the way people understood Earth&#39;s history. Geology showed that Earth was much older than the Bible implied&mdash;processes like these would require millions of years. According to Hutton, Earth had been constantly changing for so long that there was &quot;no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.&quot;</p>

<p>The cliffs at Siccar Point, Scotland dramatically reveal how layers of rock have been raised, lowered, tilted and eroded over time. We now know that these processes took millions of years.</p>

<h3>Budding Scientist</h3>

<p><span class="image-wrapper inline-image"><img alt="John Stevens Henslow, lithograph by T. H. Maguire, 1849 (Wellcome Library, London) (CC BY 2.0)" src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ee55f5e1a0388a5d723efa498d8404805f41e79.jpeg" /><span class="image-caption">John Stevens Henslow, lithograph by T. H. Maguire, 1849 (Wellcome Library, London) &nbsp;(CC BY 2.0)</span></span>At the University of Cambridge, Darwin&#39;s interest in natural history blossomed into far more than a hobby. An elite circle of prominent professors served as mentors and role models for Darwin. He became the particular protege of the Reverend J. S. Henslow, a brilliant and charismatic botanist. Darwin called meeting Henslow the event &quot;which influenced my career more than any other.&quot;</p>

<p>Encouraged by Henslow, Darwin developed a &quot;burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of natural science.&quot; To help him brush up on his geology, Henslow introduced Darwin to Adam Sedgwick, one of Britain&#39;s preeminent geologists. Reverend Sedgwick took Darwin on an eye-opening geological expedition through Wales. Darwin recalled, &quot;This tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the geology of a country&quot;--a skill Darwin would need much sooner than he imagined</p>

<h3>The Man Who Walks With Henslow</h3>

<p>Darwin&#39;s mentor at Cambridge, J. S. Henslow, was known for his popular botany lectures and field outings. &quot;It was obvious that Darwin was Henslow&#39;s favorite pupil,&quot; a fellow student recalled. &quot;Professor Henslow used to say, &#39;What a fellow that Darwin is for asking questions!&#39;&quot; The two became so close that Darwin was known as &quot;the man who walks with Henslow.&quot; Henslow profoundly shaped Darwin&#39;s thinking about the nature of species.</p>

<h3>&quot;A Tropical Glow&quot;</h3>

<p>After a flurry of studying over Christmas break, Darwin passed his degree exam in January 1831, finishing tenth on a list of 178. He remained at Cambridge two more terms, during which he became obsessed by a desire to travel and began planning a trip to the Canary Islands. &quot;My head is running about the Tropics,&quot; he wrote his sister Caroline. &quot;My enthusiasm is so great that I cannot hardly sit still...I have written myself into a tropical glow.&quot;</p>
